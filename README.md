# Awesome Embodied Category Discovery [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of research where **robots or embodied agents navigate / explore environments** and simultaneously **discover new object categories / concepts** through unsupervised or self-supervised means.

## Overview

This list only includes papers that meet both criteria:

1. The method involves an **embodied agent / robot** that moves or observes over space/time.  
2. The method performs **novel category / object discovery** (clustering, modeling new object classes, etc.)

We do *not* include static-dataset novel class discovery works or methods that merely detect “unknowns” without building new categories.

  - 💻 [Code](https://github.com/hermannsblum/scim)

## Datasets & Simulators

These are useful platforms for running experiments in embodied navigation and perception:

- **Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D / HM3D-Semantics)** — real indoor scans for navigation + semantic labeling  
- **Replica / ReplicaCAD** — scanned indoor scenes with class / instance labels  
- **iGibson / Gibson** — simulated indoor environments with navigation + object interaction  
- **AI2-THOR / ProcTHOR** — interactive household environments supporting movement + manipulation  
- **JRDB** — egocentric robot video dataset (robot motion + perception)  
- **NovelCraft** — simulation environment designed for novelty detection / category discovery with an active agent
